export const sharpe_ratio_tt = `What is Sharpe Ratio? In simple words, it is a financial metric showing how an investment is performing relative to its risk. The higher an investmentâ€™s risk ratio is, the more returns it offers relative to its risks and a portfolio with a higher Sharpe ratio is considered superior relative to its peers. Calculations are based on the United States' Risk-Free Rate.`

export const volatility_tt = `Historical volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns over a specific period for a given security or market index. It represents how much the price of an asset varies over time. High volatility means that the price of the asset can change dramatically over a short period in either direction, indicating a higher level of risk. Conversely, low volatility implies smaller price swings and, therefore, lower risk. Investors often look at volatility to gauge the risk associated with a particular investment or to compare the risk levels of different assets. In summary, volatility is a key indicator of the risk in an investment and is often analysed with performance to give a complete picture of performance vs volatility (Sharpe Ratio).`
