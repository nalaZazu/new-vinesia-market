    text: `Fine wine, like other tangible assets, tends to have a more predictable market value compared to volatile assets like stocks, bonds or crypto. The value of fine wines grows over time as it matures and becomes rarer, making it a relatively stable investment.

This quote sums it up perfectly: "Buying shares in a company is risky: management can fail, reputations can be damaged and competitors can disrupt its entire business model. 
Wine on the other hand is blissfully simple. Once bottled and reviewed by critics, you already know enough to significantly minimize your risk.`,

    title: "Resistant to inflation",
    text: `Tangible assets like fine wine, gold, and real estate have historically served as an effective hedge during inflation periods. Fine wine in particular often retains or increases its value as it is not directly tied to the value of currency. 

In addition, the demand for high-quality wines is global, which can protect against localized economic downturns or inflation. This worldwide market can help stabilize and potentially increase the value of fine wines.`,

    title: "Low correlation to traditional markets",
    text: `The performance of the wine market tends to be uncorrelated with traditional financial markets. 
Consider that fine wine has historically shown a correlation of 0.12 to the S&P500, which demonstrates an almost complete de-correlation to the stock market.
    
During the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent shocks like COVID-19 or at the start of the Ukraine war, while many asset classes experienced significant losses, the fine wine market remained relatively resilient.
Limited drawdowns and low volatility in years of crisis make it a very attractive asset class to diversify an investment portfolio.`

    text: "Certainly, Vinesia offers the option of home delivery for your wine investment. However, it's essential to consider that storing wines at home transforms them into a largely illiquid asset, complicating a potential resale. Selling requires finding a buyer yourself, managing shipping logistics, and ensuring the new buyer knows possible customs fees. Additionally, wines stored at home come with the challenge of proving optimal storage conditions. While wines are stored with Vinesia, investors enjoy a VAT-free investment due to the bonded warehouse. Requesting delivery will set you back your country-specific VAT. Shipping fees to your home and potential customs fees will apply (should these apply in your country). Storing your beautiful wines in our warehouse presents significant financial advantages for those who do not need them for immediate consumption.",

Investing in vintage commodities, such as old cars or watches, begins with verifying authenticity. At Vinesia, we source our wines exclusively from winemakers, allowing us to guarantee 100% authentic provenance to our investors and collectors.How does it come to life?Upon the delivery of wines from the winemakers to our Luxembourg warehouse, a tamper-proof NFC tag is applied directly over the top of the bottle or across the lid of the case. Breaking this seal indicates that the bottle has been opened or tampered with. This NFC tag transmits a unique identifier to the blockchain (Polygon), serving as the wine's certificate of authenticity. This certificate remains valid for the bottle's lifetime, whether stored in our warehouse or after delivery.",

      question: "What makes wine a viable investment alternative when searching for more “conventional” assets?",
      answer: "As an alternative investment, wine typically offers portfolio diversification, as its performance is not directly correlated with traditional financial markets. Fine wines have been shown to appreciate over time, especially as they become rarer and approach optimal drinking windows. Unlike stocks or bonds, wine investments can also be considered tangible assets with cultural significance. Fine wine has also demonstrated resilience during economic downturns, often outperforming other asset classes, for example, the S&P 500."

      question: "Why should I invest in wine with Vinesia over other alternatives?",
      answer: "Buying wines through Vinesia offers several advantages over its competitors. You only need to speak to a rep if you want to. What you see on our marketplace is what you can get. We are not telling you that we will build that “ultimate funky super-special wine portfolio for you” while simply assembling what we can source in the background. The photos will always be actual photos of your bottles or cases, not random 3D renderings, as lovely as they may look. The wines come directly from winemakers; you do not have to worry about whether the wines may be counterfeit. When you want to sell your investment, you do not have to call anyone – you just put it for sale on the marketplace with a couple of clicks. Or maybe someone will have made an unsolicited bid for your asset, which you accept. We want the investment experience on both sides of the trade to be easy and transparent.\nMeanwhile, while the wine is under our supervision, you can access several tools, which serve as 1. Proof of Authenticity, 2. Proof of Ownership, and 3. Proof of Storage Conditions.\nTo make it simple, we strive to bring you as close as possible to your investment.\n"

This applies to the wine you purchase through Vinesia, as it is held in our bonded warehouse in Luxembourg. This arrangement defers any duty until the wine leaves the warehouse, meaning you will not pay VAT on the wine while it is stored with us. Vinesia uses a bonded warehouse to provide a secure environment that maintains the quality and value of your wine investment over time."
