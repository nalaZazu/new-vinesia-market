    text: "The concept of Peace of Mind is paramount in alleviating the fear associated with investing in rare and exquisite wines. Investing in vintage commodities, such as old cars or watches, begins with verifying authenticity. At Vinesia, we source our wines exclusively from winemakers, allowing us to guarantee 100% authentic provenance to our investors and collectors.  How does it come to life? Upon the delivery of wines from the winemakers to our Luxembourg warehouse, a tamper-proof NFC tag is applied directly over the top of the bottle or across the lid of the case. Breaking this seal indicates that the bottle has been opened or tampered with. This NFC tag transmits a unique identifier to the blockchain (Polygon), serving as the wine's certificate of authenticity. This certificate remains valid for the bottle's lifetime, whether stored in our warehouse or after delivery.",
